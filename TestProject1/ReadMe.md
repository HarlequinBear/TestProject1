# ENSEK Remote Software Tester exercise

Rather than write out a full test plan, I jumped straight into creating some automated tests using Playwright.

I hope that by showing my automation skills, you can trust that I know how to create effective tests.

However, I found that the database was down, so the test just fills in the registration form and stops where the database call would be made.

I also added a couple of API tests. One of which is a data driven test. These tests got a 405 Method Not Allowed error.

I believe I've demonstrated my ability to create automated tests. I'm sure I could've done more, but I already spent a lot of time on this exercise.

I'm happy to talk in the next interview about how I would complete the tests if the database and API were working.
